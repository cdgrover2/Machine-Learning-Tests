The first test involved using 70 years worth of NCAR/NCEP Reanalysis data for KMCI airport (Kansas City, MO). Memory issues plague large scale tests so these first trials are scaled down to one grid to maximize temporal coverage.

%2/13/2024: The one grid sample is for KMCI (Kansas City, MO). The first
%trial used 10 years worth of data. The resulting ML output were reasonable
%values with similar data patterns but overall different specifics which
%make it a bad model. If you run the model again, you get the exact same
%results which is somewhat comforting. The next trial will attempt to
%expand the years worth of data but I anticipating memory issues. I will
%reach out to Prof. Chagnon on any advice to get around this.
%A trial of 70 years worth of KMCI data revealed no improvement to data
%despite using all variables so there must be more to improving the model
%than just giving it more data. Nevertheless, broad oscillation patterns
%are repeated and comparable to the original.
